# GraduationCountDownBot
This bots script runs every day at noon using a PythonAnywhere scheduler. It takes the current day and year and calculates the days until the next graduation. It then tweets that information to students. The graduation days come from the Graduation_Days.txt file. 

On days that a graduation is occurring, it congratulates the class of the year and doesn't inform of any impending graduations. That day is for the graduates after all!
